# School_District_Analysis
BootCamp Week4 Working with Pandas
The analysis should contain the following:
## Overview of the school district analysis
  Previously, we supported the Data Analytics team in a study about the results of schools in the area in the Proficiency Standard Test for math and reading, based on the type of school, its population and its budget, in order to help the School Board in making decisions.
  Subsequently, based on a report of academic dishonesty in the 9th grade of the Thomas High School, we have been asked to repeat the previous analysis and determine how much the previous results are affected if we discard the results in question.
  
## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
First, we neutralize the THS 9th grade results in Math and Reading in order to begin tne analysis. I did it replacing the grades with NaN.

From these new data, I repeated the analysis of the schools performance in reading and math to determine how the results previously found were affected and how.

How is the district summary affected?
How is the school summary affected
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type
Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
